Meant to be ran as a scheduled task in my VDI Template. 
It checks if the VM is in the domain, if not, it renames the PC and adds it to the domain
On the next launch it runs again and sees that it is in the domain, so it installs the Citrix VDA 
Next launch it sees it's in the domain, and has citrix. Does nothing. 

The first IF for the domain check has a nested IF/ELSE to check that the VDA is installed. Change *domain.com to your domain.
